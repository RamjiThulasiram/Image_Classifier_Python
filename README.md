# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

# Image Classifier 

  Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.
  
  In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.
  
  When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset.
  
  *This is the final Project of the Udacity AI with Python Nanodegree*


## Prerequisites
The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip
``` 
to upgrade it 
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```
Additional Packages that are required are: [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), PIL and json.\
You can donwload them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pil
```
or [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
```
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib pil
```
